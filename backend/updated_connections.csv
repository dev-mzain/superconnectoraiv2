I get the greatest sense of satisfaction when I am leading and working with high-performance, cross-functional teams in building, optimizing, and delivering solutions and programs that fuel business growth.  For over 18 years, I have had multiple opportunities to lead the strategy planning, development, execution, and launch of multiple complex projects and programs for a global leader in payment processing technology solutions.  My career began at the ground level in sales support and customer service. Over the years, I rapidly advanced to managerial and leadership positions that intersected with operations, business development, product marketing, product management, partnership implementation, and service transition. Over these years, I built a reputation for my ability to work strategically—and enthusiastically—with diverse departments and external partners and vendors to go above and beyond getting the job done.  My collaborative leadership style led to the launch of many popular programs and sales contests. I have also been influential in designing and introducing business processes—supported by my MBA—for acquiring and retaining strategic partners that gained a competitive edge and secured the desired results.  I have been exposed to both the front- and back-end business operations within tiered and vertical market environments. Through these experiences, I have gained a multifaceted appreciation for energizing teams in resolving business challenges across various organizational contexts.  Most importantly, I credit my talent for building positive professional relationships with internal and external stakeholders, executive leaders, operations teams, and external partners and vendors as a primary tool for business success.

I’m looking forward to applying my 18+ years of well-rounded experience in partnership implementation, service transition, and product and project management to work with IT, sales, marketing, and operations teams to understand, train, and adapt processes that help clients meet and exceed their business needs, while learning new paradigms, languages, and libraries. ) || Company: Worldpay, Roles: (Title: Service Transition Manager, Duration: Aug 2016 - Oct 2018 · 2 yrs 3 mos, Location: Atlanta, Description: My success in leading and managing the partnership implementation department, combined with my experience working with IT teams landed me in the role of Service Transition Manager.  As the primary liaison between business and technical teams, I played a key role in planning and coordinating service transition processes and the various risks related to modifications and transitions within live operational environments.  My primary challenge involved leading the start-up of the US-based Service Transition Department. In the beginning, I was confronted with resistance from Project Managers and business teams in introducing new changes. By being open and engaging with our UK counterparts and actively hearing and addressing their concerns, I was able to gradually help the team see the bigger picture.  In addition, I made every possible effort to ensure that our first project was a success by engaging and involving each team member in its completion. In the end, I was able to design and modify the UK’s service transition processes to integrate seamlessly with its US counterparts.  I contributed to a couple of other initiatives to support business growth objectives:  ►Coordinated resource logistics and relocated 800+ employees to a new location in Atlanta’s Midtown business district. ►Expanded transaction capabilities by revamping the pay process systems—a 1.5 year endeavor—and migrating old transaction to a brand new system within a tight, 2-day timeframe.  Unfortunately, I was part of a massive layoff that occurred in the fall of 2018. Since then, I’ve invested my professional development through pursuit of project management and ITIL courses.  | Title: Partnership Implementation Manager, Duration: Sep 2012 - Aug 2016 · 4 yrs, Location: Atlanta, Description: My previous product management, marketing, and sales experience combined with my wealth of knowledge in Worldpay’s front- and back-end systems led to my progression to Partnership Implementation Manager. This time, Worldpay was establishing a new department and needed someone to manage the acquisition and onboarding of new partners.  In collaboration with a 7-member team of Implementation Relationship Managers, I forged strategic partnerships with leading e-commerce, technology, and financial service partners and directed a series of sales, marketing, and product management initiatives that led to the creation of new value-add business programs.  Over the course of 4 years, I significantly advanced my program management skills, while consistently meeting and exceeding expectations.  Some of my proudest achievements included:  ►Increased YOY sales 20% through strategic relationship management and program development and execution. ►Joined forces with a leading e-commerce marketplace partner to launching my first program within an aggressive timeline. ►Coordinated the large-scale development and launched my second program in the form of our first merchant self-service app.  One of my greatest achievements, from an operational perspective, was developing the partnership implementation model. I designed a robust framework for evaluating potential partners and gathering strategic business insights to determine program requirements for our potential partners.  Through my efforts, I consolidated the model components into one single process, which was crucial in order to cope with the projected growth and demand in partnerships. Over the years, I continued to refine the process, including adding a pipeline management and implementation transition process, as well as a resource allocation checklist for each partner.  In 2016, I was promoted for the sixth time to Service Transition Manager.  | Title: Product Manager, Duration: Nov 2011 - Sep 2012 · 11 mos, Location: N/A, Description: I advanced to the role of Product Manager, where I carried over my previous experience in product marketing to oversee the end-to-end product management lifecycle processes in alignment with Worldpay’s revenue targets.  My efforts were heavily focused on market research, including competitive landscape analysis and forecasting, project planning and implementation scheduling, and developing comprehensive product roadmaps to guiding cross-functional teams in delivering the final end product.  To put it simply, I defined the why, when, and what of the product we were building.  My greatest challenge as Product Manager was securing funding for all of the different programs. I quickly learned that I would have to show proof that we were on the right track with a new product or program. Drawing on my recent MBA, I performed feasibility analyses and constructed business cases to support the development of product roadmaps and pricing and commission structures.  I regularly asked myself (and my teams) important questions such as:  ►How will we know its working? ►What does success look like at certain points along our journey? ►What are the targets we want to hit?  By maintaining this awareness within myself and across the different teams—IT, sales, marketing, customer support, and project management—I worked with, we were able to work together in proactively identifying and closing any gaps across the different groups and meet our targets. My newly enhanced business background also supported me in creating presentations at the executive level for CEO and executive-led committees.  By autumn 2012, I was promoted into my next role as Partnership Implementation Manager. ) || Company: SunTrust Bank, Roles: (Title: Financial Services Representative II, Duration: Sep 1999 - Jun 2000 · 10 mos, Location: N/A, Description: N/A)","Name: Georgia State University - J.

My experience includes startup product creation and scaling experiences to millions of consumers. I'm a true product nerd and love everything about product management, from design to data analysis. The only thing I love more than building products is building teams. I've been fortunate to learn from some of the best product minds in the world who believed in me and put me in a position to succeed. I hope to do the same for all of the PMs, designers, program managers, and analysts on my team.  At CrossFit, we're on a mission to solve the world's most vexing problem: chronic disease. My team's job is to build software that helps us solve that problem. We build the software that powers the CrossFit Games season, B2B software tools for CrossFit gym owners, and the software that powers CrossFit's online and in-person seminars.   Before CrossFit, I spent 6 years at Under Armour, managing MapMyRun. Our signature accomplishment was building the in-app experience for Under Armour's Connected Footwear (""Shoes That Coach You""). We scaled this product from zero to millions of customers and $180M in revenue.   After Under Amour, I worked on a consumer productivity app with a stealth startup. It hasn't launched yet, but it's going to be amazing. :)  My roots as a PM are in design. Before I knew what a product manager was, I spent five years at frog design. And while I love UX design, I'm also a very data-driven product manager. I'm not a ""data fundamentalist,"" though.

As the leader of a new ly formed organization tasked with establishing operations to support numerous software applications across existing devices and standalone apps, I contributed to Samsung's transformation from a standard Android app store to a provider of differentiated services. This shift propelled Samsung to become the number one selling smartphone OEM worldwide within a few short years.  One key challenge was to ensure that our operations kept pace with the rapid developments. My team consistently raised customer satisfaction levels in critical areas such as downloading, onboarding, self-help, and customer support experiences. Our efforts were recognized through accolades, as we were acknowledged for having one of the most forward-thinking omni-channel support programs in the industry.

Our focus was on developing managed network, device, security, and cloud services. Through these efforts, my team established an additional initial revenue stream of $150 million. Although impressive, this figure paled in comparison to the overall network connectivity revenue we were safeguarding.  Direct sales played a crucial role in our revenue generation, but we also recognized the importance of supporting our wholesalers who drove business in the midmarket and SMB segments. To cater to their needs, we successfully launched a suite of white-labeled, cloud-based services. This enabled wholesalers to preserve their existing network revenue while offering upsells for cloud-based storage and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solutions.  By strategically diversifying our offerings and emphasizing the value of managed services, we effectively reduced the risk of commoditization for internet and networking services.

I just kept architecting solutions that solved real problems — and the role found me.  What began as writing ETL jobs inside a Fortune client of Wipro, then moving to migrating and designing  healthcare solutions turned into a nearly two decade journey across analytics engineering, cloud architecture, and AI strategy — spanning the UK, U.S., and India. Along the way, I’ve helped organizations modernize data ecosystems, drive business agility, and navigate the real-world adoption of AI and GenAI. Today, I am part of Strategy and Technology Architecture Advisory Group and lead Accion Labs’ Analytics & Data Practice and serve as Field CTO for some of our most strategic clients, where technical leadership and executive advisory come together.  Some highlights I’m proud of:      Practice Builder: Scaled a data, cloud, and AI practice into a multi-million-dollar business line     Solution Architect: Designed resilient, scalable data platforms across industries and geographies     GenAI Pioneer: Used synthetic data and LLM agent strategies to solve compliance and governance challenges     Industry Recognized: Named one of North America’s Top 50 Data Consultants by CDO Magazine     CXO Advisor: Trusted by executives to align data, cloud, and AI investments with long-term growth  I work best in environments where clarity is non-negotiable, complexity is the norm, and technology must earn its right to exist by serving the business, not the other way around.  My long-term vision is to step into a broader CTO mandate — and ultimately lead a consulting business that helps forward-thinking leaders harness the full potential of data, cloud, and AI to build durable advantage.  My north star: Architect what matters. Teach what lasts. Leave systems better — and smarter — than I found them.  If you’re exploring ways to unlock more value from your data, cloud, or AI initiatives — I'd love to have a conversation.
